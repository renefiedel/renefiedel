### Hi there, I'm Renetus Masanja! 👋

🚀 I'm a passionate space enthusiast and aspiring geospatial data analyst. I'm on a journey to explore the cosmos through data and technology.

🌍 Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in geospatial data processing, working with Earth observation data to uncover insights about our planet. In my free time I enjoy studying and building projects related to orbital dynamics and understanding the motion of asteroids.

🛰️ I'm always open to collaboration on space-related projects. If you share the same passion for the cosmos, let's connect and create something amazing!

📫 You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renetus) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/renetus). Feel free to send a message if you have questions or ideas or just want to chat about space and technology.
